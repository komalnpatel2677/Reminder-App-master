A Reminder App can help you set reminders for different events that you have throughout the day. Itâ€™ll help you stay updated with all your tasks for the day. It can be useful for all those who are not so good at organizing their plans and forget easily. This would be a simple application whose task would be just to remind you of something at a particular time.

In this, the user would be able to set reminders and time in the application. Users can schedule reminders that would remind them to drink water again and again throughout the day. Or to remind them of their medications.
